  <h1>ðŸŒ± A Proposal Close to My Heart: MIDAS, AI, and the Future of Agroforestry</h1>

  <p>Earlier this year, I had the privilege of submitting a proposal to the <strong>Michigan Institute for Data Science (MIDAS)</strong> under their <strong>AI for Society Fellowship Program</strong>. While the proposal was appreciated and accepted, it unfortunately didnâ€™t receive funding. Still, the experience was deeply rewarding, and Iâ€™m excited to share the story behind it.</p>

  <h2>ðŸŒ¿ The Vision: Smarter Agroforestry Through AI and Remote Sensing</h2>

  <p>Agroforestryâ€”combining agriculture with tree cultivationâ€”offers one of the most promising land-use solutions to tackle climate change, improve rural livelihoods, and enhance biodiversity. But one of the biggest barriers to scaling agroforestry is the <strong>lack of timely, accurate monitoring tools</strong> that can assess tree cover, carbon sequestration, and crop productivity.</p>

  <p>My proposal aimed to address this challenge by integrating <strong>AI, remote sensing, and in-situ data</strong> to monitor the dynamics of agroforestry systems in India, particularly focusing on:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Mapping tree cover in agricultural landscapes</li>
    <li>Quantifying carbon sequestration potential using satellite data and modeling</li>
    <li>Analyzing crop yield impacts via time-series remote sensing indices</li>
    <li>Building a decision-support framework for farmers and land managers</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ðŸ¤– Why MIDAS and AI for Society?</h2>

  <p>The <strong>MIDAS AI for Society Fellowship Program</strong> is designed to support data science projects that create tangible societal impact. This resonated perfectly with the spirit of my proposalâ€”leveraging cutting-edge AI for something deeply rooted in sustainability and rural development.</p>

  <h2>âœ¨ What Made This Proposal Unique</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Multi-Disciplinary Approach</strong>: It combined remote sensing, carbon modeling, machine learning, and agricultural research.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalable Methodology</strong>: Built on open platforms like Google Earth Engine and QGIS.</li>
    <li><strong>AI-Driven Insights</strong>: Included models like Random Forest and CNN to classify vegetation and estimate biomass.</li>
    <li><strong>Open-Access Tools</strong>: Aimed to develop public tools for broader community benefit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ðŸš€ Though Not Funded, the Journey Continues</h2>

  <p>While the proposal didnâ€™t get funded, it was a milestone in my research journey. It helped sharpen my ideas, exposed me to world-class reviewers and peers, and reaffirmed my belief in <strong>data-driven environmental solutions</strong>.</p>

  <p>Iâ€™ve already started working on implementing parts of the project through:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Small-scale pilots using Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery</li>
    <li>Exploring opportunities with other research institutions</li>
    <li>Planning to publish a concept note or paper based on this proposal</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Lessons and Reflections:</strong><br>
    ðŸ”¹ Sometimes, not getting selected doesnâ€™t mean the endâ€”itâ€™s just a different beginning.<br>
    ðŸ”¹ The proposal process can open up new ideas and collaborations.<br>
    ðŸ”¹ AI, when grounded in context, can empower ecological and community resilience.
  </div>

  <h2>ðŸ§­ Final Word</h2>

  <p>The MIDAS proposal wasnâ€™t just about winning a fellowshipâ€”it was about building something meaningful at the intersection of technology and ecology. If you're working in similar spaces or want to collaborate on data-driven agroforestry or climate solutions, Iâ€™d love to connect!</p>

  <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
