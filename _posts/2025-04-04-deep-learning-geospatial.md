In recent years, the integration of **Deep Learning** with **Remote Sensing and GIS** has opened up exciting possibilities. From detecting land cover changes using satellite images to predicting natural hazards, neural networks are enabling faster and more accurate spatial decision-making.

In my research, I have applied CNNs and semantic segmentation to tasks like **mangrove classification**, **landslide prediction**, and **blackspot detection**.

Stay tuned as I share more insights and real-world applications of deep learning in the geospatial domain! 🌍📊
